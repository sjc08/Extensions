# Extensions

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Asjc.Extensions)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Asjc.Extensions/)

Provides some extended, simple but useful **static classes** (mostly for extension methods).

**Warning: Due to design issues, updates to this package will be suspended. Consider using [Asjc.Utils](https://github.com/SJC08/Utils), which fully inherits the functionality of this package and is easy to migrate to**
